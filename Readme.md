# Django & Django REST framework test project.

Have successfully implemented the API requirement delivering available non blocked listings.
The test links are
 1 . localhost:8000/listingpagination/ ( for paginated list)
 2 . localhost:8000/listingfull/ ( full query set)


Field and Type errors as well as format errors are replied with appropriate error messages.

Have used only a single query argument to deliver the listing. Please feel free to go through views and models to dive into the code.
